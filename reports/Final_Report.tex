\title{
Investment Shocks and The Commodity Basis Spread}

\begin{abstract}
In this study, we aimed to replicate the results from Table 1 of \cite{Yang2013}, which examines the effect of investment shocks on commodity basis spreads.
Using commodity futures data sourced from LSEG via the WRDS (Wharton Research Data Services) platform, we conducted rigorous statistical calculations and analysis in an attempt to validate the original findings.
Our replication effort involved data fetching, a detailed pre-processing stage, and an extensive analysis phase.
The entire process, including our methodology, is documented and available in a public GitHub repository.
This repository is automated end-to-end using py-doit, allowing users with WRDS access to replicate our results with ease.

\section{Introduction}
\textit{``Intermediary Asset Pricing: New Evidence from Many Asset Classes''} \cite{He2017}, which explores the role of financial intermediaries in asset pricing, is an oft-cited paper that covers a range of asset classes that we have explored in this course.
Given the interests of us authors, we have chosen to replicate the results of \cite{Yang2013}, which focuses on the commodity asset class.
The paper examines the effect of investment shocks on the commodity basis spread, which is the difference between the futures price and the spot price of a commodity.
The visualization / data of focus in our work was Table 1 of \cite{Yang2013}, which presents the results of their analysis of basis spreads across many different commodities.

Basis calculation was done like this formula:

\begin{equation}
    B_{i,t} \;=\; \frac{\ln\bigl(F_{i,t,T_1}\bigr)\;-\;\ln\bigl(F_{i,t,T_2}\bigr)}{\,T_2 \;-\; T_1\,}
  \label{eq:basis_formula}
\end{equation}

Excess return was done like this formula:

\begin{equation}
  R^e_{i,t+1,T} \;=\; \frac{F_{i,t+1,T}}{F_{i,t,T}} \;-\; 1
  \label{eq:return_formula}

    varies much more than in table 3 with ratios from 127 for Western barley and -137 for Coal. This highlights the effect of a smaller sample
    as well as the inconsistency of the return/risk metrics.

\section{Further Analysis}
In this section, we present several visual explorations of the commodity dataset. We begin by illustrating 
the coverage of monthly observations across products, noting any key gaps in the data. Next, we examine 
how different commodities correlate with one another, shedding light on which products tend to move together 
or diverge. Finally, we review long-term trends in monthly settlement prices, highlighting notable fluctuations and 
patterns in specific commodities.

  Each row corresponds to a specific commodity (with its symbol), and each column 
  indicates a monthly period. Dark squares signify the presence of data for that commodity-month 
  combination, while light squares show missing data. Notably, there is no data for Broilers (BR) 
  and a pronounced gap around 2009, illustrating non-uniform coverage across the dataset.}

\FloatBarrier

In analyzing coverage patterns across a diverse set of commodities, we identified notable gaps 
for certain products, as well as irregular coverage around specific periods like 2009. By examining 
correlation heatmaps, we observed that most commodities tend to move in moderate unison, though a few pairs 
exhibit distinctly negative relationships. The monthly settlement price data further highlighted that certain 
markets have experienced significantly higher fluctuations over time. Overall, Yang's paper yields an interesting 
strategy surrounding commodities, but without complete replication, and more in-depth knowledge of how he constructed
this table, it is hard to validate his approach and findings.
